# XRInteractionExperiments - Drawing

## Core Interactions

### Description

The core interaction I implemented was drawing on a surface, I explored different methods on the range of realistic to artifical, from drawing with a pen, to drawing by pointing, to drawing with a joystick.

### Drawing on surface with hand physically

Can press tip down to draw on a surface in 2D.

### Drawing on surface with hand and line trace

Can draw on surface by moving hand with line trace

### Drawing with joystick and line trace

Can use the joystick to control lines projected onto surface when button is held

## User Interviews

### Observations and Reflections

Users were split on if they liked the hand and line trace drawing or pen drawing more. Both from observations seemed to be intuitive and enjoyable, however is was universally agreed by both responses and obversations that joystick drawing was worse. The joystick interaction could be improved by it taking place on a different hand or increasing the sensivity and therefore range it works in.

The ability to reach things in the scene was also difficult, so some form of locomtion would have helped to interact with the environemnt. From the design standpoint, I thought the pen was the most interesting, and after talking with some users, I think implementing the pen system with a handheld notebook could be cool while still allowing drawing on a range of surfaces and that part being emergent.

### Pre Prototype Questions & Responses

#### Do you prefer being stationary or having a space to move around in in VR?

1. Stationary
2. Space to Move
3. Only experience is stationary, but moving around is better if not nauseous
4. No preference, only been stationary
5. Depends on game, space to move is cool but not nessecary, beat saber does a good job of making interesting motion with limited space

#### What is your past experience with drawing?

1. No experience
2. Some pencil and sketchpad
3. A little more than average, art classes
4. Sketch a lot, recently learning technical drawing but beginner
5. Minimal, done it but at amateur level

#### Do you prefer using controller inputs or a realistic tool to complete a task in VR?

1. Having a tool
2. Tool is better, moving around and doing actions is whole point of vr
3. Using tool, even if just a marker
4. Using tool
5. Using tool

### Post Prototype Questions & Responses

#### What was the best interaction?

1. Hand and line trace
2. Pen
3. Hand and line trace
4. Hand and line trace
5. Pen

#### Did you feel limited by your movement options?

1. At first with canvas, then no
2. Limited in abilit to approach canvas
3. No
4. Limited to reach objects without more space
5. Didn't feel limited

#### Out of the bottom two interactions, which one felt worse and why?

1. Joystick felt less intentional, too senitive
2. Joystick doesnt feel like you could draw
3. Pen felt most intuitive
4. No joystick, joystick on other hadn would feel better
5. Drawing with joystick is worse cause of limited range and have to use both motions
